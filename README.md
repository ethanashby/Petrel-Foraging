# Analysis of Antarctic Petrel Foraging Trips

Antarctic Petrels (Thalassoica antarctica) are an important Antarctic sentinel species. Using publically available GPS data on Movebank (https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-main), I analyzed Antarctic Petrel foraging data over the austral summers of 2012-2014 for the Final project of my Avian Ecoloogy class in the spring of 2020. I plotted Petrel foraging paths, faceted by year and month. I observed high variability in foraging behavior and determined that the length of petrel forage trips were significantly different across different years.

To determine possible causes of this variability, I visualized the pretrel foraging trips in light of remote sensing data, corresponding to various environmental variables like sea surface temperature, net primary production, locations of large icebergs, and sea ice cover. After integrating these data, I identified a phenomenon where petrels tended to forage in regions of low to moderate sea ice cover (<50% cover), corresponding to the sea ice edge. This finding was supported by the scientific literature (Delord, K. et al., R. Soc. Open Sci. 7, 2020). This project represented a data-driven approach to understand the ecology of an important Antarctic sentinel species.
