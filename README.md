# Petrel-Foraging
Avian Ecology Final Project: Machine Learning and Spatial Statistics of Antarctic Petrel Foraging

Antarctic Petrels (Thalassoica antarctica) are an important Antarctic sentinel species. Using publically available data on Movebank (https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-main), I analyzed Antarctic petrel foraging data over the austral summers of 2012-2014 for the Final project of my Avian Ecoloogy class.
